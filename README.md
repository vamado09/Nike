Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing Textblob and WordCloud to extract sentiment from the text reviews, providing deeper insight into customer sentiments towards Nike products.
Predictive Modeling: Implementation of logistic regression to predict outcomes based on the review data, enhancing the ability to foresee customer satisfaction.
Correlation Analysis: Investigating the relationships between different variables with a heatmap to understand the interdependencies, especially the strong correlations between prices.
